# flight_information

The Flight Info App presents data consumed from the flights API as a simple information board.

The app separates Arrivals and Departures on to a single page view to reflect what you would see on airport information screens in the terminal.

As the data is live, the information is updated every 30 seconds using the setInterval() method.
